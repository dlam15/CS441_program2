Derrick Lam  
## CS441 Multiple Screens

For this assignment I created an app that can go to dictionary.com to
search the meaning of words. I included a Popup Window when a button
is clicked to be able to select a word to search and I also added
webviews that would search dictionary.com for the selected word.
Additionally I added a another page that will randomly appear when
trying to search and this page goes to the YouTube video of Rick
Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up.
